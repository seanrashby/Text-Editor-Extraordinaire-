  ## Description
  A simple text editor that has online and offline functionality by using a variety of data persistens options to ensure the data is never lost. The app first looks to use the data in iDB to populate the editor, then if it doesn't have access it will use local storage. 
  
  AS A developer
  
  I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
  
  SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
